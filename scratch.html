  <p><a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/'>Scratch</a> is a block based programming language. I got interested back in November 2015 and created an account on the 28th of November. 
    I have not looked back since, creating about 250 (bad) projects on the site. These projects were bad, so I have unshared every awful project since 2020, but I'm still happy I made them.</p>
    This is my latest project:

  <p> In December 2020, after posting a suggestion on former Scratch Team member <a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/users/amylaser/'>amylaser's</a> profile <a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/462613/'>it was a duplicate of the 3rd biggest suggestion topic lol</a> I got really into the forums!
    I mostly got into suggestions; I love expressing my opinion. I was not the best forumer, but I think I have got better. I joined <a href='scratch.mit.edu/studios/30136012/'>The Forum Helpers</a> in March and I now think I can become a manager, but no one has suggested me yet. Hope someone does soon lol!</p>
<p> can look at my posts <a href='https://ocular.jeffalo.net/user/dertermener'>here</a> and my forum stats (which have dwindled a lot lol) <a href='https://postpercent.rirurin.com/users/dertermenter'>here</a>.</p>
