<p><a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/'>Scratch</a> is a block based programming language. I got interested back in November 2015 and created an account on the 28th of November. 
I have not looked back since, creating about 250 (bad) projects on the site. These projects were bad, so I have unshared every awful project since 2020, but I'm still happy I made them.</p>
This is my latest project:

<p> In December 2020, after posting a suggestion on former Scratch Team member <a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/users/amylaser/'>amylaser's</a> profile, she redirected me to the forums, so I made <a title="It was a duplicate of the 3rd biggest suggestion topic lol" href='https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/462613/'>my suggestion</a> and I got really into the forums!
I mostly got into suggestions; I love expressing my opinion. I was certainly not the best forumer, but I think I have got better. I joined <a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30136012/'>The Forum Helpers</a> in March 2021 and on the 24th of Feburary 2022 I became a manager!</p>
<p> can look at my posts <a title = "Ocular, the all in one forum search tool for scratch" href='https://ocular.jeffalo.net/user/dertermenter'>here</a> and my forum stats (which have dwindled a lot lol) <a title="postpercent, the all in one forum statistics tool for scratch" href='https://postpercent.rirurin.com/users/dertermenter'>here</a>.</p>
